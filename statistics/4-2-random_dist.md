[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> Below is the python code.
```python
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot
import numpy as np

def main():

	# Generate the 1000 random numbers between 0 and 1
	ran_num = np.random.random(1000)

	# Plot the pmf.
	pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(ran_num)
	thinkplot.Pmf(pmf)
	thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random number', ylabel='PMF')
	# thinkplot.Show()

	# Plot the cdf.
	cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(ran_num)
	thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
	thinkplot.Config(xlabel='Random number', ylabel='CDF')
	thinkplot.Show()



if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```
Trying to plot 1000 values on the same pmf plot is problematic because it is nearly impossible to distinguish the distinct random numbers generated by np.random.random. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) solves this issue by creating a percentile rank to each value. Since each value generated by np.random.random should have equal probability then the cdf plot should be (and is) a linear line.
